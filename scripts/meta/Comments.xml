  <row Id="3973" PostId="2344" Score="0" Text="@AndriyM the query is `SELECT * FROM` and MySQL _isn't_ using the primary key to do this. This is because InnoDB (BUT NOT MyISAM) uses a clustered primary key. So basically the primary key is a BTREE of the primary key columns with pointers to the rows. An index is a (structure) containing some columns and the primary key. In my example there was a _covering index_ which could be read directly (not requiring any lookups) and thus was faster. In the absence of an order by MySQL was free to do this. At the time I was coming from MyISAM, also indexes that contain THE ENTIRE TABLE are rare."

It's like using an index in a database: in general it is faster to use the index (i.e. read a list of possible reasons that indexes might not be used) than it is to do a full table scan (i.e., search through all possible posts about indexes)."
